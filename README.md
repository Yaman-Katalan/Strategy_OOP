# Strategy Pattern Implementation

This Python project demonstrates the implementation of the Strategy design pattern. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable.

## Components

### Interface

- **Strategy (ABC)**: An abstract base class defining the interface for all concrete strategies. It declares a method `set_text_case()` that must be implemented by concrete strategies.

### Concrete Classes

- **UpperCase**: A concrete strategy that converts text to uppercase.
- **LowerCase**: A concrete strategy that converts text to lowercase.
- **TitleCase**: A concrete strategy that converts text to title case.
- **SwapCase**: A concrete strategy that swaps the case of characters in text.
- **CapitalizeCase**: A concrete strategy that capitalizes the first character of text.

### Context

- **Context**: The context class maintains a reference to the current strategy object. It allows switching between different strategies dynamically and delegates the work to the strategy object.

## Example

The example provided in the script demonstrates the usage of different text case conversion strategies. Here's how to use it:

```python
# Create a context with a default strategy (e.g., UpperCase)
context = Context(UpperCase())

# Apply strategies and get results
print(context.get_result("hello world!"))  # Output: HELLO WORLD!
print(context.get_result("Hello World!"))  # Output: HELLO WORLD!

# Change strategy dynamically
context.set_strategy(LowerCase())
print(context.get_result("Hello World!"))  # Output: hello world!

context.set_strategy(TitleCase())
print(context.get_result("hello world!"))  # Output: Hello World!
```

## Usage

To use this pattern in your project:

1. Implement the `Strategy` interface for each algorithm.
2. Create concrete classes that extend the `Strategy` interface and implement their specific algorithms.
3. Create a `Context` class that uses a strategy object to execute a particular algorithm.
4. Use the `Context` class to change strategies dynamically as needed.
